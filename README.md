# Contemplate It

Contemplate It, a place for intellectual minds to share ideas philosophically.

The Contemplate It web site/forum will pose weekly questions that cover hot-button topics. We will also offer daily questions on a 
variety of subjects. You are welcome to respond to any issues that interest you. 

Contemplate It offers you a place to let others know your thoughts on topics important to you. You can provide your comments, 
criticisms, and observations related to our posts or posts made by others. For a monthly fee, we provide a blog service that allows 
you to publish your own articles, thoughts and ideas. 

We believe you will find our site unique. Contemplate It is different because we encourage users to say what they think without the 
use of “fighting words”. We ask you to respond to posts philosophically (i.e. a theory backed by evidence). 

Our goal is to help each other learn to debate without enticing anger. Ask yourself how often you’ve felt regret at words spoken in 
haste? Through practice we can learn to always respond in logical manner, even to ideas that incense us. Therefore, the next time 
someone makes a statement you disagree with, don’t react, Contemplate It.
